                    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
                    that
                    show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going
                    to
                    make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing.
