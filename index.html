                    Got to say I have been wanting to write this for a while and finally just now have the time and I guess (more honestly) the drive to write it. I also accomplished something that has been on my todo list which is this blog itself. Yes I know it’s not super fancy PHP or connected to a backend but it functions perfectly for what I need it for, which is to share knowledge and maybe inspire some people. This brings me to the point of my story. Where it all started, the place, the feelings, everything.

                    It started 3 years ago when I decided I needed to take coding seriously. You see prior to learning these skills, I tried before. I was actually enrolled on community college for coding and I hated it. Could not stand it all and ended up quitting and switching my major. Fast forward a couple years later, some student loan debt and a kind of useless associates in business I found myself homeless and jobless. I had no hopes or many choices, it felt weird and vulnerable.

                    I didn’t have much at the time but oddly enough I still managed to hold on to a cell phone. Sometimes I’d have minutes and other times I wouldn’t. Wifi on the other hand was usually available and if you are clever you can find plenty of spots that offer free wifi. Having that to my disposal I found myself watching a lot of YouTube videos on coding and people starting their own businesses.
