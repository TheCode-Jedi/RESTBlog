# RESTBlog
Simple blog site made with HTML5, CSS3 w/ Sass (SCSS) and JavaScript. Currently has no back end it's just static. I'm planning on using PHP and MySQL for backend to keep things simple. Also thinking of going the REST route hence the name RESTblog. The purpose of the blog is simple. It's a personal blog where I will share my thoughts on various coding, design and tech topics. This project is on-going and will feature many updates as time goes on. Feel free to clone this and add to it!
