                    Got to say I have been wanting to write this for a while and finally just now have the time, and I guess (more honestly) the drive to write it. I also accomplished something that has been on my to do list which is this blog itself. Yes I know it’s not super fancy with PHP or connected to a backend but it functions perfectly for what I need it for, which is to share knowledge and maybe inspire people. This brings me to the point of my story. Where it all started, the place, the feelings, everything. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It started 3 years ago when I decided I needed to take coding seriously. You see prior to learning these skills, I tried before, years earlier. I was enrolled on community college for coding and I hated it. I could not stand it all and ended up switching my major. Fast forward a couple years later, some student loan debt and a kind of useless associates degree in business, I found myself homeless and jobless. I had no hopes or many choices, it felt weird and vulnerable.

                <p>
                    I didn’t have much at the time but oddly enough I still managed to hold on to a cell phone. Sometimes I’d have minutes and other times I wouldn’t. Wifi on the other hand was usually available and if you are clever you can find plenty of spots that offer free Wifi. Having that at my disposal I found myself watching a lot of YouTube videos on coding to kill the hard times. I saw stories upon stories of people starting businesses and landing good paying careers.

                    It inspired me, watching normal everyday people transform their lives by learning a set of skills. I remember specifically one day watching a video that contained an ad for something called <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a> I was surprised that I watched the whole ad since I'm notorious for skipping YouTube ads. This ad was different for some reason. The guy featured in it seemed normal, like someone I would know. I say this because this guy was not some super genius mathematician stereotype everyone thinks developers are. (Not to take away from how smart a lot of devs are)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ad got me into what’s known as the YouTube rabbit hole where you watch one video and then the algorithm suggests another video of a similar topic. This led me to find other success stories from Team Treehouse and I eventually found myself on their site about to sign up. This is important because I had exactly $25 to my name and Team Treehouse was $19.99 a month. I took advantage of the free week trail and told myself you got this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time I did not have a laptop or a way to access Team Treehouse efficiently. I was sleeping at a friends couch and didn’t really have a lot going for me work wise even though I was applying everywhere. The problem with having no marketable skills is that finding a job that allows you to pay bills and have enough left to save is very hard. With that thought as motivation I was able to secure a laptop from a great friend who believed me and this wild dream of teaching myself code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a laptop secured and the week trail of Team Treehouse I was ready to start my journey. But like all good journeys a road block presented itself in the form of losing the couch I was sleeping on. This was a big blow to me due to the fact that it discouraged me heavily. I let the fact that I was doing something productive and good let me think that something bad wouldn’t happen. But life works that way a lot of the time. Lucky for me the same person that allowed me the laptop also gave a spot to stay till I got back on my feet. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I remember still sneaking in every night into this place. My friend did not tell his family member which they were living with at the time I was staying there. So I would sneak in and out as I could without being noticed, sometimes standing in rain till it was "safe" to go in. I managed to find a Starbucks for the day time when I couldn’t be at this place. Starbucks is great for a couple reasons; they have A/C which in Florida is a big deal, they have "clean" bathrooms, and can’t deny you water. Being homeless makes you appreciate those simple things so I was super glad I had a Starbucks near by.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    For 7 days a week, 10 to 12hrs a day for 2 months I would sit at this Starbucks. Absorbing as much as I could from the Front-end developer track over at Team Treehouse. In that time I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS along with the basics of JavaScript. With those 3 skills I was able to put together simple sites and mocks ups. I also picked up Adobe Photoshop while teaching myself about CSS. With these 4 skills I was now able to design and wireframe websites and code those designs. This was now enough for me to create a portfolio and start attracting freelance clients. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had an idea while looking for jobs one morning. I saw that a lot of them required experience, sometimes years. But how do you get experience if you need experience to get experience? I decided that I would take on freelance clients that need simple things like PSD to HTML conversions or static HTML sites and used those projects as case studies and experience. With the above skills I was able to land 2 local clients in a realitvely short amount of time using a couple Craigslist ads. One client needed a website redesigned and needed mobile designs. The other needed a small WordPress site for a family owned epoxy flooring business.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    This all happened about 2 months into the Treehouse front-end developer program. I told myself that once I was finished with the two clients that I would switch to <a href="https:///www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and attempt the Web Developers Bootcamp by Colt Steele. At the time I was hearing great things about that course and felt like I needed a switch from the Treehouse format. I signed up and went through the basics pretty quickly. I also now had a pretty nice portfolio full of good examples of personal projects and actual paid ones. As I was going through this course I started applying for jobs.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had another great idea where I would apply everywhere that came up on Indeed for my specific keyword search and area. I know what you're thinking, "You applied to all of them?, Even the ones you were not qualified for?" My answer is yes. The reason was simple, if they reach back and I can get at least a phone interview. I can use what I learn there for the next job interview. Almost like getting the interview jitters/anxiety out the way. For the jobs that I was not qualified for, a lot of the didn’t call back but the ones that did and offered coding challenges I would do my best. Obviously these coding challenges were high level stuff I couldn’t handle so I would fail these bad boys but, the knowledge gained going through the process was enough to make it worth while.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    After 20+ interviews later, I landed a full-time job at small marketing agency as a Jr. Front-end developer. The team was small so I doubled as a designer and dabbled into Social media marketing and SEO. I had finally achieved something that at one point in my life was impossible for me. This all happened in the span of 3 months from start to finish. It sounds unrealistic even to me now as I write it. But when you are dedicating 40-50hrs a week into something and want to change your life so bad that you will do anything, trust me you’ll get it done.    
                </p>

                <p>
                    In those short few months I went from sleeping on a couch and making $5.50 and hour to learning a skill set that secured me money to eat and landed me $40k a year job that allowed to me out of my homeless situation and into an apartment and stability. Using the freelance clients as experience and case studies was a great idea that helped me immensely when it came to my job search. I learned so much in those months and I’m thankful for places like Team Treehouse for what they do.    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The take away from all of this is that you can be from anywhere or background. It doesn’t matter what race you are or language you speak. YOU can do this, YOU can change your life. YOU can learn anything. YOU are smart, beautiful and capable of anything. Believe in yourself specifically when you don’t want to. I believe in you, even if I don’t know you. I know your struggle even though I’ve never walked In your shoes.
